# Voice-Assistant
This repository contains a Python-based chatbot that uses the DialoGPT model for conversational AI and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for converting text responses into speech. The chatbot is designed to run in environments like Google Colab, where direct audio playback is not available but can also run locally.
